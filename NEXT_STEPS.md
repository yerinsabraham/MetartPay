## ðŸ”„ **NEXT STEPS (Phase 2 - NFC Integration):**

### ðŸ“± **NFC Implementation Plan:**

#### **Option A: Quick Implementation (Recommended)**
- Use **Web NFC API** (works on Android Chrome, some iOS)
- Add NFC write functionality to existing "Receive Payments" screen
- Encode the same payment link URL into NFC tags

#### **Option B: Native Implementation**
- Add `nfc_manager` package to Flutter
- Implement native NFC read/write functionality
- Better device compatibility but more complex

### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Add NFC dependencies** to `pubspec.yaml`
2. **Create NFC service** for reading/writing tags
3. **Add NFC section** to Receive Payments screen
4. **Enable NFC writing** of payment link URLs
5. **Test with physical NFC tags/cards**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Next Action:**

### **Should we proceed with:**
**A)** Test the new "Receive Payments" screen first (see what we built)
**B)** Implement NFC functionality immediately
**C)** Focus on another priority feature

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing the Current Implementation:**

### **To test what we just built:**
1. **Run the mobile app**: `cd mobile && flutter run`
2. **Navigate**: Home screen â†’ "Receive Payments" button
3. **Test flow**: 
   - Enter amount: â‚¦5,000
   - Select network: Solana
   - Select token: USDT
   - Generate payment link
   - See QR code and share options

### **Expected Result:**
- âœ… Professional interface for sellers to receive payments
- âœ… QR code generation for customer payments  
- âœ… Multiple network/token options
- âœ… Ready for physical shop usage

## ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation:**

**I recommend we test the "Receive Payments" screen first** to ensure it works perfectly, then add NFC as the next enhancement. This gives you a fully functional payment receiving system that sellers can use immediately.
